# UI Frontend Test

## Task

We're not looking for a pixel perfect version of this modal but are more interested in the approach taken to produce the HTML markup, classnames, base styling and any other considerations that would need to be taken into acount when creating this component.

This can be demonstrated by creating a coded up version of the modal that we can easily run in a browser, alternatively we're just as happy for the candidate to whiteboard and talk us through their approach.
